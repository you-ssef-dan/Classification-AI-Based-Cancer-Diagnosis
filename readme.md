# Classification AI-Based Cancer Diagnosis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes machine learning techniques to classify cancer diagnoses.

## Files

- `AI cancer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing AI-based cancer classification.
- `cancer.csv`: Dataset containing cancer-related data (ensure this file is available).

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "AI cancer.ipynb"
```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Train a machine learning model for cancer classification
   - Evaluate model performance

## Description

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Training a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or neural network)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
